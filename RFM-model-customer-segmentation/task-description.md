# RFM model - customer segmentation
***
## Background
The data set depicts a portion of the Amazon trading platform's transaction data in 2020 (because it is derived from the underlying buried point data, certain fields are missing, and the rows with missing fields must be filtered out), and you can choose to discard the missing rows. Based on the data presented above, stratify the total number of users based on user value, tap the potential value of users, and empower the business side to complete the segmentation of user groups.

## Illustrate
Buried point data: It is understood as the layer of the most primitive collected data. For example, for example, which buttons you clicked on the interface on the webpage, how long you stayed, how much exposure of the buttons, etc., these most primitive data indicators are accumulated through buried points; transmitted from the client There may be missing and omission of data on the server side

## Task
1. Segment user into three levels, and the logic of the layering should be simple.
2. Begin with the level of user consumption and value for the time being.
